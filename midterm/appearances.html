    <h3>that a person is an aggregate of appearances,
appearances which can be made to yield, by proper focusing, infinite layers of significance. To view reality as an endless set of situations which mirror each other, to extract analogies from the most dissimilar things, is to anticipate the characteristic form of perception stimulated by photographic images.</h3>

    <p><i>Granville Carroll:</i>&emsp;To understand representation in photography is to understand how you are interconnected to the thing in which you photograph. It is to accept the responsibility for how you depict a particular subject. Understanding the deep impact images have in our society is the reason for teaching representation in any capacity. It holds people accountable for their actions, words and perceptions. </p>

    <p><i>Jennifer Ouellette:</i>&emsp;Your Facebook page, for instance, is one gigantic identity claim. It's how you wish to be perceived. If you want to get artsy-fartsy, you could say it's a form of performance. ... I think the selfie phenomenon is a different version of that. It is definitely a way of saying, 'Here I am. This is me.' It's a mirror kind of thing, particularly since people often turn the camera on themselves.</p>
