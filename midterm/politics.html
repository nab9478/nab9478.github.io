    <h3>Cameras define reality in the two ways
essential to the workings of an advanced industrial society: as a
spectacle (for masses) and as an object of surveillance (for rulers).
The production of images also furnishes a ruling ideology. Social
change is replaced by a change in images. The freedom to consume
a plurality of images and goods is equated with freedom itself.
The narrowing of free political choice to free economic
consumption requires the unlimited production and consumption
of images</h3>

    <p><i>Colin Pantall:</i>&emsp;The idea of the photographer as activist is an appealing one. It means that photographs really matter, that they can lead to changes in representation, attitudes and policy. Labelling photography as activism elevates the camera from being a functional tool in the service of a publisher to something altogether higher. It transforms the photographer from a shutterbug to a prophet, someone with real vision and moral standing in the world, someone with power.</p>

    <p><i>The.me:</i>&emsp;In a way, however, all photography is political. Because all photography takes place in a social and cultural context and is, even if unintended, a form of suggestive manipulation. It is important to be aware of the power of a reproduced reality and its intended or unintended effects on us. The power of the image starts with the framing.</p>
