    <h3>And as in even the most dreadful, or

        the most banal photograph-document can mutate into an emblem
        of desire.</h3>

    <p><i>lil.sub.chrxssy:</i>&emsp;To Hofrat Behrens, in The Magic Mountain, the
        pulmonary X-rays of his patients are diagnostic tools. To Hans
        Castorp, serving an indefinite sentence in Behrens‚Äôs TB
        sanatorium, and made lovesick by the enigmatic, unattainable
        Clavdia Chauchat, ‚ÄúClavdia‚Äôs X-ray portrait, showing not her
        face, but the delicate bony structure of the upper half of her body,
        and the organs of the thoracic cavity, surrounded by the pale,
        ghostlike envelope of flesh,‚Äù is the most precious of trophies. </p>

    <p><i>amanda_Wyatt:</i>&emsp;photographs of car accidents which the narrator‚Äôs friend Vaughan
        collects while preparing to stage his own death in a car crash. The
        acting out of his erotic vision of car death is anticipated and the
        fantasy itself further eroticized by the repeated perusal of these
        photographs.</p>

    <p><i>aly_b1rch:</i>&emsp;At one end of the spectrum, photographs are
        objective data; at the other end, they are items of psychological
        science fiction. </p>
