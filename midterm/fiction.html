    <h3>There is an art and there are fashions of seeing
        things in order to make them interesting; and to supply this art,
        these fashions, there is a steady recycling of the artifacts and tastes
        of the past.</h3>

    <p><i>Christina Reid:</i>&emsp; Clich√©s, recycled, become meta-clich√©s. The
        photographic recycling makes clich√©s out of unique objects,
        distinctive and vivid artifacts out of clich√©s. Images of real things
        are interlayered with images of images. The Chinese circumscribe
        the uses of photography so that there are no layers or strata of
        images, and all images reinforce and reiterate each other. </p>

    <p><i>Diego_theexplorer:</i>&emsp;  We make of photography a means by which, precisely, anything can
        be said, any purpose served. What in reality is discrete, images
        join. In the form of a photograph the explosion of an A-bomb
        can be used to advertise a safe.</p>
