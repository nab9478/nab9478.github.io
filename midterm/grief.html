    <h3>Few people in this society share the primitive dread of cameras
that comes from thinking of the photograph as a material part of
themselves. But some trace of the magic remains: for example, in
our reluctance to tear up or throw away the photograph of a loved
one, especially of someone dead or far away. To do so is a ruthless
gesture of rejection.</h3>

    <p><i>Ruby Boddington:</i>&emsp;It hones in on a shared experience of humanity through an interpersonal lens ‚Äì it‚Äôs at once universal and hyper intimate. It encourages empathy and self-reflection and above all, it‚Äôs simply a testament to the importance of honesty, communication, strong relationships and self-love.</p>

    <p><i>Xuan-Hui Ng:</i>&emsp;I began photographing as a form of self-therapy. I was grieving over the loss of my mother, who had been both my confidante and my moral compass. Although I accepted her death, I ran from grief by burying myself in work. However, my work environment, like most, was not conducive to healing. Relationship issues further compounded my pain and left me at the lowest point in my life..</p>
