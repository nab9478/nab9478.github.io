    <h2>Expansion of Knowledge</h2>
  </div>

    <h3>A third form of acquisition is that, through
image-making and image-duplicating machines, we can acquire
something as information (rather than experience). Indeed, the
importance of photographic images as the medium through which
more and more events enter our experience is, finally, only a
byproduct of their effectiveness in furnishing knowledge
dissociated from and independent of experience.</h3>

    <p><i>Alfredo Cramerotti:</i>&emsp;We need to refer to images (and image-making) in order to act politically, socially, and culturally. An expanded photography is now the set of conditions that facilitates our awareness of such interconnected layers a visual system that searches, finds and acts out meaning as it constitutes it (with or without camera). Recollected, imagined or existing photographs contribute to our knowledge and perception of the world and of ourselves. Thus expanded photography is an approach to life that, nevertheless passes through different stages, visual systems, signs and formats. The photographical functions as hyperimage, translating and transcoding visual information from one format to another.</p>

    <p><i>Helmut Erich Robert Gernsheim:</i>&emsp;An effective photograph can disseminate information about humanity and nature, record the visible world, and extend human knowledge and understanding. For all these reasons, photography has aptly been called the most important invention since the printing press.</p>
