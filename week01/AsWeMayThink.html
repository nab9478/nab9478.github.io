    <h1>RE: AS WE MAY THINK</h1>
    <img style="float:left;" src="TNCopy.jpg" width=400px>
    <p id="p1">This article reminded me heavily of an essay I wrote regarding to ethics
      and technology where I compared a box of tangled necklaces to our current
      technological state. Everything is interwoven, so much so that we can't
      seem to completely understand how everything works in full. As time
      goes on, due to our hunger for things shiny and new, we continue to add to
      the mess without ever understanding it entirely. Bush is very Eager to
      develop new technology for organizing the information that already exists in
      order to speed up invention, but why would we add more necklaces to
      the mess before trying to untangle them? </p>
    <p id="p2">Another topic discussed in the article is the idea of organizing
      information into data trails that replicate the way we think. Looking
      forward on today, many artificial intelligence machines seem to accomplish
      this pretty well. However, do we really know how the human brain works?
      We know a lot, but we don't know everything. Another question rises: how
      can we replicate something of which we don't understand entirely?</p>

    <p id="p3"><br>We are so eager for new technology and always assume it will progress us
      forward or help us in some way. This causes us to push new technology into
      the world without fully examining the repercussions.<em> We are creating things
      we don't understand in a world we don't understand. </em>To me, this article is an
      example of how our mindset around technological progress hasn't matured
      much, and how we continue to add to the impossible mess of technology.</p>
