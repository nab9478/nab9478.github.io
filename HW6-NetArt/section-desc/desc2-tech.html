        9 Eyes started in 2008, shortly after Google Street view first launched in 2007. Using a spherical camera with 9 lenses, Google Street View photography aimed to, as Google’s mission states, “organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful.” Jon Rafman utilitzed Google’s database to compile photographs he felt drawn to. While Google’s intention may not have been to create art, Jon Rafman is able to do so by capturing moments of importance, narrative, and beauty. His work can be found on multiple blog sites including Tumblr and ArtFCity and in book form and print versions in the New Museum’s 2009 exhibition known as “Free.”
