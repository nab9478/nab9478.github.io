      I grew up in suburbs of Missouri where we used to call houses like these “McMansions”; all the houses in the neighborhood were built the same and lacked character. Upon viewing this photo I am immediately hit with nostalgia, although I have never been to the location of this house. This personally applies Rafman’s suggestions about foreign familiarity and romanticism to my perspective and experience.

      An automated picture, meant to have no meaning, looks intentional; if not given any context the viewer might interpret the meaning of the photo or the artist’s goal when there isn’t one. What implications does this have? What does this say about the ethics of Google Street View?
